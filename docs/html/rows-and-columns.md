# Rows and Columns

`AddRow` lays out columns side by side - e.g. a logo next to a company name,
or a stat strip with three centered numbers - within the content width. It's
available in `Content`, `Header`, and `Footer`, but columns themselves can't
nest another row inside them.

## Building a row

```csharp
c.AddRow(row =>
{
    row.AddColumn(48, col => col.AddImage("logo.png", widthPx: 40));
    row.AddColumn(col =>
    {
        col.AddText("Acme Corporation").Bold().FontSize(20);
        col.AddText("123 Market Street").FontSize(12);
    });
});
```

[`RowBuilder`](https://github.com/sahebansari/TerraFluent.Html.Reporting/blob/master/src/TerraFluent.Html.Reporting/Fluent/RowBuilder.cs) has two
`AddColumn` overloads:

- **`AddColumn(Action<RowColumnBuilder> configure)`** - an auto-width column
  that shares the leftover width equally with other auto-width columns.
- **`AddColumn(double widthPx, Action<RowColumnBuilder> configure)`** - a
  column with an explicit fixed width.

`ContentBuilder.AddRow`/`PageSectionBuilder.AddRow` both take the same
signature:

```csharp
AddRow(Action<RowBuilder> configure, double columnGapPx = 12, RowVerticalAlignment verticalAlignment = RowVerticalAlignment.Middle)
```

and return a `RowHandle` for chaining margin modifiers (see
[Styling: Rows and row columns](/docs/html/styling/#rows-and-row-columns)).

## Column width resolution

Same algorithm as table columns (see
[Tables: Column width resolution](/docs/html/tables/#column-width-resolution)):
fixed-width columns get exactly what you specified; whatever's left after
subtracting fixed widths *and* the gaps between columns
(`columnGapPx * (columnCount - 1)`) is divided equally among the auto-width
columns. If fixed widths and gaps alone exceed the available width, auto
columns are pinned to `0` (their content isn't visible) - this now records
a `LayoutWarning` with `LayoutWarningReason.ColumnWidthCollapsed` rather
than failing silently, and you can opt into throwing instead via
`RowStyle.ColumnWidthOverflowMode` or document-wide via
`ReportDocumentBuilder.UseStrictLayoutValidation()` - see
[Pagination and Layout: Warnings](/docs/html/pagination-and-layout/#layoutwarning-when-content-doesnt-fit).

## Vertical alignment

When columns in the same row have different content heights, `RowVerticalAlignment`
controls how the shorter ones line up against the row's tallest column:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `Top` | Aligned to the top of the row. |
| `Middle` (default) | Centered within the row's height. |
| `Bottom` | Aligned to the bottom of the row. |

```csharp
c.AddRow(row =>
{
    row.AddColumn(120, col => col.AddText("One line"));
    row.AddColumn(col =>
    {
        col.AddText("Line 1");
        col.AddText("Line 2");
        col.AddText("Line 3");
    });
}, verticalAlignment: RowVerticalAlignment.Top);
```

The row's overall height is the **tallest column's** measured height (plus
the row's own margins) - shorter columns don't stretch to fill it, they're
just positioned within it per `VerticalAlignment`.

## Column content defaults

A `RowColumnBuilder`'s text elements (`AddText`/`AddHeading`/`AddPageNumber`)
default to `marginBottomPx: 0`, unlike their `ContentBuilder` counterparts.
This is deliberate: a column's *measured* height needs to match its
*visible* content for `RowVerticalAlignment` to line columns up correctly -
if the last line in a column carried an invisible trailing margin, the
column would measure taller than it looks, and vertical centering would be
visibly off. Chain `.MarginBottom(...)` explicitly if you want deliberate
spacing between elements stacked within the same column.

`RowColumnBuilder` supports `AddText`, `AddHeading`, `AddPageNumber`,
`AddImage` (file or bytes), `AddRule`, and `AddSpacer` - see the comparison
table in [Content Elements](/docs/html/content-elements/#three-different-builders-three-different-method-sets)
for what's deliberately *not* available inside a column (tables, lists,
nested rows, page breaks, raw HTML).

## Column padding

`RowBuilder.AddColumn` returns a `RowColumnHandle` with `Padding(...)` to
inset that column's stacked content from its own box edges, independent of
the column's width:

```csharp
row.AddColumn(col => col.AddText("Hi")).Padding(8);
row.AddColumn(48, col => col.AddImage("logo.png", widthPx: 40))
    .Padding(topPx: 15, 0, 0, 0);
```

Padding reduces the *inner* width available to the column's own elements
(`column width - left padding - right padding`) without changing the
column's resolved width in the row's layout - so padding never throws off
the row's overall column-width math, it only affects how the column's
content sits within its allotted space.

## Rows never split

Like an image, a row is always placed whole. If a row doesn't fit even on a
completely empty page, it's force-placed and recorded as a `LayoutWarning` -
the same fallback described in
[Pagination and Layout: Warnings](/docs/html/pagination-and-layout/#layoutwarning-when-content-doesnt-fit).
In practice this matters for rows with a lot of stacked content in one
column (e.g. many lines of wrapped text) on a very short page - keep tall
row content modest, or split it into separate non-row elements if it might
not fit.

## Margins

A `Row` has the same four margin properties as a `TextStyle`
(`MarginTopPx`/`MarginRightPx`/`MarginBottomPx`/`MarginLeftPx`, defaulting to
`0`/`0`/`8`/`0`), set via the `RowHandle` returned by `AddRow`:

```csharp
c.AddRow(row => { ... }).Margin(12).MarginTop(20);
```

Left/right margin shrinks the width available to the row's columns from that
edge (and shifts the row right, for left margin); top/bottom margin adds
vertical space exactly like a text element's margin does.

## Multi-column sections (`AddColumns`)

`AddColumns` is a different, opt-in kind of side-by-side layout from `Row`:
instead of a fixed set of independently-sized columns holding whatever
content you put in each one, it packs one **flat** list of content into a
fixed number of **equal-width** columns automatically, filling one
completely before moving to the next:

```csharp
c.AddColumns(3, columns =>
{
    columns.AddHeading("Section One", HeadingLevel.H3);
    columns.AddParagraph("...");
    columns.AddRule();
    columns.AddHeading("Section Two", HeadingLevel.H3);
    columns.AddParagraph("...");
    // as much content as you like - it flows into column 2, then column 3,
    // then wraps to a fresh multi-column section on the next page.
}, columnGapPx: 20);
```

This is the library's "newspaper column" layout, and it behaves
differently from `Row` in ways that matter:

- **Content flows and paginates**, unlike a `Row` (which is always placed
  whole or force-placed with a warning). A paragraph or table that doesn't
  fit in the remaining space of one column splits across the column
  boundary exactly the way it already splits across a page boundary - see
  [Pagination and Layout](/docs/html/pagination-and-layout/) for the underlying
  `Measure`/`Split` contract every element (including columns' contents)
  implements.
- **Columns are always equal width** - the same "share what's left after
  gaps" math `Row`/`Table` auto-columns already use, just applied to every
  column rather than only the auto-width ones.
- **`ColumnsBuilder` supports most of `ContentBuilder`'s method set** -
  paragraphs, headings, images, barcodes, QR codes, tables, lists, rules,
  spacers, and raw HTML - except `AddRow` (a row can't span a column) and
  `AddPageBreak`/`AddColumns` (a page break and nested multi-column
  sections aren't supported inside a column's content in this version).
- **An oversized, unsplittable child** (e.g. an image taller than a whole
  empty column) is force-placed in its own column and recorded as a
  `LayoutWarning`, mirroring how the page-level engine handles the same
  situation - see
  [Pagination and Layout: Warnings](/docs/html/pagination-and-layout/#layoutwarning-when-content-doesnt-fit).
