# FAQ / Troubleshooting

## Why didn't my page break exactly where I expected?

The default `ApproximateTextMeasurer` estimates text wrapping using generic
Helvetica character-width tables, not the actual font/engine that will
eventually render the HTML - so its line-wrap decisions are *close* to a
real browser's but not guaranteed identical, especially for proportional
fonts other than a plain sans-serif, or text with heavy kerning/ligatures. If
your pagination needs to be pixel-exact, supply a custom `ITextMeasurer`
backed by a real rendering engine via `UseTextMeasurer(...)`. See
[Text Measurement](/docs/html/text-measurement/) and
[Extending the Library: A custom `ITextMeasurer`](/docs/html/extending/#a-custom-itextmeasurer).

## My header/footer text has different spacing than my content text

`PageSectionBuilder.AddText`/`AddPageNumber` (header/footer) and
`RowColumnBuilder.AddText`/`AddHeading`/`AddPageNumber` (row columns) default
to `marginBottomPx: 0`, while `ContentBuilder.AddParagraph`/`AddHeading`
default to the normal `TextStyle.Default`/`TextStyle.ForHeading(level)`
margins (`8px` bottom for body text, more for headings). This is
intentional, not a bug - see
[Styling: Margin vs. padding](/docs/html/styling/#margin-vs-padding). Chain
`.MarginBottom(...)` explicitly if you want spacing that differs from the
context's default.

## My image/row is positioned differently than I expected

- **Alignment only matters when the container is wider than the content.**
  `AlignCenter()`/`AlignRight()` on an image position its box within
  whatever width is left over after margin/padding - if the image already
  fills the available width, alignment has no visible effect.
- **Left/right margin shrinks the available width**, it doesn't just shift
  the element - an image with `MarginLeftPx: 20` inside a 200px-wide
  container effectively centers/right-aligns within 180px, not 200px.
- **Row column padding doesn't change the column's resolved width** in the
  row's layout math - it only insets that column's own content within
  whatever width the column already got. See
  [Rows and Columns: Column padding](/docs/html/rows-and-columns/#column-padding).

## Why does my row/image/heading move to the next page instead of splitting?

Only `Paragraph`, `ReportList`, and `Table` support partial splitting.
`Heading`, `ReportImage`, `Row`, `HorizontalRule`, `Spacer`, `PageBreak`,
`RawHtml`, and `PageNumberText` always move whole to the next page if they
don't fit - see
[Pagination and Layout: The `IReportElement` contract](/docs/html/pagination-and-layout/#the-ireportelement-contract).
If one of these is also taller than an entire empty page's content area, it
gets force-placed (overflowing visually) and recorded in
`LayoutResult.Warnings` rather than dropped - see
[Pagination and Layout: Warnings](/docs/html/pagination-and-layout/#layoutwarning-when-content-doesnt-fit).

## `AddTable`/`Table` throws `ArgumentException` about cell counts

Every row passed to a table must supply exactly one cell per column.
`table.AddColumns("A", "B")` followed by `table.AddRow("only one value")`
throws, naming the offending row index. Check that every `AddRow(...)` call
matches the column count from `AddColumns`/`AddColumn`.

## `LayoutEngine.Paginate` throws `InvalidOperationException`

This means the page geometry leaves no room for content at all:

- *"Left/right margins leave no horizontal room for content."* - `Margins.Left + Margins.Right >= PageSize.WidthPx`.
- *"Margins and header/footer leave no vertical room for content."* - `Margins.Top + Margins.Bottom` plus the header's and footer's combined *measured* height (see
  [Pagination and Layout: Headers and footers](/docs/html/pagination-and-layout/#headers-and-footers))
  is `>= PageSize.HeightPx`.

Reduce margins, shrink the header/footer content, or use a larger page size.

## Does `PageOrientation.Landscape` work with a custom `PageSize.FromPixels(...)`?

Yes - orientation is a plain width/height swap applied uniformly, regardless
of how the `PageSize` was constructed. It is **not** a "force width > height"
coercion: a custom size built via `FromPixels` rotates exactly the same way
`A4`/`Letter`/`Legal` do. See
[Core Concepts: Page geometry](/docs/html/core-concepts/#page-geometry-pagesize-margins-orientation).

## Can I nest a row inside a row, or a table inside a row column?

No. `RowColumnBuilder` (what configures one column's content) deliberately
exposes a smaller method set than `ContentBuilder` - no `AddRow`, `AddTable`,
`AddList`, `AddPageBreak`, or `AddRawHtml`. See the comparison table in
[Content Elements](/docs/html/content-elements/#three-different-builders-three-different-method-sets).
If you need a table or list inside what's visually a row-like layout,
consider `AddColumns` instead (a `MultiColumnSection` column *can* hold a
table or list, unlike a `Row` column), `AddRawHtml` with a manually computed
height, or restructure the content to avoid the nesting. See
[Supported Composition Patterns](/docs/html/composition-patterns/) for the full
picture across `Row`, `Table`, and `AddColumns`.

## Why does `RawHtml`/`Spacer` need an explicit height?

The layout engine measures every element by calling `Measure`, which for
ordinary elements computes height from the element's own content and style.
`RawHtml` wraps markup the engine doesn't understand (it can't run a browser
layout pass on it), and `Spacer` has no content to measure at all - both
simply report back whatever height you constructed them with. If the
content you put in `RawHtml` is actually taller than the height you supply,
the engine still treats it as that height for pagination purposes - the
`overflow:hidden` wrapper will clip anything taller for that block specifically,
but pagination decisions for surrounding content won't see the real height.

## Is this thread-safe?

`LayoutEngine.Paginate` and `ApproximateTextMeasurer` are stateless and safe
to call concurrently, including for the same `ReportDocument` (it's
immutable). `Table`/`Row` use an internal measurement cache that may
redundantly recompute under concurrent pagination of the very same instance -
a benign race, not a correctness issue. See
[Pagination and Layout: Thread safety](/docs/html/pagination-and-layout/#thread-safety).

## Known limitations

As of this release:

- **Text measurement is approximate by default.** Exact, pixel-perfect
  pagination requires supplying a custom `ITextMeasurer` (see
  [Text Measurement](/docs/html/text-measurement/)) - none ships in the *core*
  package, though a reference Playwright-backed sample measurer exists at
  [samples/TerraFluent.Html.Reporting.Sample.PlaywrightMeasurer](https://github.com/sahebansari/TerraFluent.Html.Reporting/blob/master/samples/TerraFluent.Html.Reporting.Sample.PlaywrightMeasurer).
- **Custom font embedding exists but is a manual data-URI embed, not a font
  subsystem** - `ReportDocumentBuilder.EmbedFont(...)` embeds a font file as
  a base64 `@font-face` rule; there's no font discovery, subsetting, or
  fallback-stack management beyond what you configure yourself.
- **Multi-column page layout (`AddColumns`) is conservative by design** -
  equal-width columns only, fill-then-wrap (no balanced/equal-height
  rebalancing), no column-spanning elements, and it can't nest inside
  itself or inside a `Row` - see
  [Rows and Columns: Multi-column sections](/docs/html/rows-and-columns/#multi-column-sections-addcolumns).
- **A table `RowSpan` group can't split across a page break** - it either
  fits together on a page or moves to the next page as a whole; see
  [Tables: Column and row spans](/docs/html/tables/#column-and-row-spans).
- **Right-to-left (RTL) text support covers `dir`/`direction` only** -
  `TextStyle.Direction` is independent of `TextAlignment`/margin/padding,
  which stay physical (`Left`/`Right`), not logical (`Start`/`End`) - see
  [Styling: Text direction](/docs/html/styling/#text-direction) for what to set
  explicitly for a fully mirrored layout.
- **Rows don't nest, and row columns can't contain a table, list, nested
  row, page break, or raw HTML** - see
  [Supported Composition Patterns](/docs/html/composition-patterns/) for the
  full picture (including what `AddColumns` columns *can* hold instead).
- **No shrink-to-fit for table/row columns** when fixed-width columns
  already exceed the available width - auto columns are pinned to `0`.
  This is no longer silent: it records a `LayoutWarning`
  (`LayoutWarningReason.ColumnWidthCollapsed`), and you can opt into
  throwing instead via `TableStyle`/`RowStyle`'s `ColumnWidthOverflowMode`
  or document-wide via `ReportDocumentBuilder.UseStrictLayoutValidation()`.

## Where to go next

- [Pagination and Layout](/docs/html/pagination-and-layout/) for the full
  algorithm behind most of the answers above.
- [Extending the Library](/docs/html/extending/) if the built-in elements/measurer/renderer
  genuinely don't cover your case.
