# Troubleshooting


## Building A Document Throws An Exception

TerraFluent.Docx.Reporting validates fluent API inputs eagerly, before any Open XML is written, so configuration mistakes fail fast at the call site instead of producing a damaged or unreadable `.docx`:

- `ArgumentNullException` - a required callback, object, or stream argument was `null` (e.g. `Document.Create(null)`, `Component(null)`).
- `ArgumentException` - a required string was `null`, empty, or whitespace (e.g. an image file path or page number format), a stream was unreadable/unwritable, or a barcode value contained a character outside ASCII 32-126.
- `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` - a numeric value was outside its valid range, such as a negative margin, a non-positive width/height, or a column count outside 1-45.

See [Public API Contract](/docs/docx/api/#public-api-contract) for the full validation contract.

## Word Shows A Repair Prompt

Run the automated tests and inspect the generated document with Word.

```powershell
dotnet test TerraFluent.Docx.Reporting.sln
```

Common causes:

- Invalid color values. Use six-character hex strings such as `1F4E79`, not `#1F4E79`.
- Invalid page number formats. `PageNumberFormat` writes the OOXML value as-is. Use values like `decimal`, `lowerRoman`, `upperRoman`, `lowerLetter`, or `upperLetter`.
- Mixed chart types in one chart. All chart series must use the same kind.
- Multiple series in a pie or doughnut chart. These chart types support one series.

## Images Do Not Appear

Check the path or byte data supplied to the image API.

```csharp
page.Content().Image("logo.png", image => image
    .Width(120)
    .AltText("Company logo"));
```

Tips:

- Use an absolute path when the current working directory is unclear.
- Ensure file names have supported extensions such as `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg`.
- Missing file paths and empty image byte arrays throw during document creation or publishing.
- Use `AltText` for accessibility and easier inspection.
- Use `MaxWidth` when documents may receive images of unknown size.

## Template Values Are Not Replaced

`DocxTemplate.Replace("Name", value)` replaces `{{Name}}`, including placeholders split across Word runs. It intentionally does not replace every bare occurrence of `Name`, which avoids accidental edits to ordinary document text.

For authored Word templates, prefer tagged content controls for business fields:

```csharp
DocxTemplate.Open("template.docx")
    .ReplaceContentControl("CustomerName", "Ada Lovelace")
    .SaveAs("output.docx");
```

Content controls are matched by tag or alias.

## Page Background Does Not Change Per Section

Word stores page background as a document-wide setting. If multiple sections call `Background`, the first non-empty value wins.

Use section-specific watermarks or shaded containers when you need visual differences per section.

## Table Of Contents Does Not Show Page Numbers Immediately

The TOC is emitted as a Word field. Word normally updates fields when you open the document or explicitly refresh fields.

In Word, select the table of contents and choose update field.

## Layout Differs Between Word And LibreOffice

Open XML rendering can differ between applications. Before publishing templates or report layouts:

- Test in Microsoft Word.
- Test in LibreOffice if your users rely on it.
- Avoid overly tight fixed-width tables.
- Prefer relative columns for responsive report tables.
- Keep images within page margins with `MaxWidth`.

## NuGet Package Missing Docs Or License

Pack the project and inspect the package:

```powershell
dotnet pack src\TerraFluent.Docx.Reporting\TerraFluent.Docx.Reporting.csproj -c Release -o artifacts\nuget
tar -tf artifacts\nuget\TerraFluent.Docx.Reporting.*.nupkg
```

The package should include:

- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `LICENSE.txt`
- `lib/netstandard2.0/TerraFluent.Docx.Reporting.dll`
- `lib/netstandard2.0/TerraFluent.Docx.Reporting.xml`
- `lib/net10.0/TerraFluent.Docx.Reporting.dll`
- `lib/net10.0/TerraFluent.Docx.Reporting.xml`

See [Release And Publishing](https://github.com/sahebansari/TerraFluent.Docx.Reporting/blob/master/docs/RELEASE.md) for the full checklist.
